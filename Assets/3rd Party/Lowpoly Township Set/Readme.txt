Lowpoly Township Set


This pack contains 3d models such as buildings, some environment and textures to them, using this, you can create levels for mobile games.


To create a snow textures, it was necessary to change the UWV coordinates of these models:

- Forge
- Large house
- Mill
- Tavern
- Woodmill
- Well

Please, replace these models for you project if you already use them, textures no need to change. 

In the last update, there were changed axis directions, if you already use Lowpoly Township Set, update the models carefully.

For my winter scene, please replace textures on trees materials by winter textures for them and terrain textures:

First - by "Snow"
Second - by "Snow_2"
Third - by "Ground_1_snowy"
Forth - by "Ground_2_snowy"
Fifth - by "Snow_3"
